If you use any custom lexicons, be sure to put them in a sub-directory off the root 
of your apps called "lexicon". Fusebox will look for them here.  If you use 
many custom lexicons, then you can consider putting them in sub-directories below 
the "lexicon" dir, being careful to specify the path to them in your 
application's circuit.xml relative to the "lexicon" dir.
